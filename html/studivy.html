          <h3>1. Project Overview – Studivy Web App</h3>
          <p>This web-based app was built collaboratively by a team of four, aiming to predict student performance and recommend the most suitable instructors. I was responsible for the backend and machine learning pipeline, while others contributed to frontend, design, and testing. The 'About' section showcases the team, roles, and overall vision of the application.</p>

          <h3>2. Interactive Web Form for Predictions</h3>
          <p>I developed the user input form that lets users select course-related information such as course name, semester, department, and difficulty level. Upon submission, the system predicts and displays the top 3 recommended instructors in real time—making the system interactive and easy to use.</p>

          <h3>3. Result Visualization with Chart.js</h3>
          <p>To make the recommendation output more intuitive, I used Chart.js to display instructor prediction probabilities in a clean and responsive bar chart. This helps users and stakeholders easily compare scores and understand the reasoning behind each recommendation.</p>
